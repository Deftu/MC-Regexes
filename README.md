# Minecraft regexes
Welcome! This GitHub repository only has one
purpose: providing new and old Minecraft mod
developers quick and easy access to cool, useful
and commonly used/needed regular expressions.

Please do know, much of this list if biased towards
legacy (1.8.9) modding on Hypixel and servers like it.
If you'd like to add regexes for later versions or your
own usecases, go ahead!
